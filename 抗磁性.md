# Overview

**Diamagnetic** materials are repelled by a magnetic field; an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, [[顺磁性|paramagnetic]] and [[铁磁性|ferromagnetic]] materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials; when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances, the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of [[magnetic dipole|magnetic dipoles]] in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than the permeability of vacuum $\mu_0$. In most materials, diamagnetism is a weak effect which can be detected only by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a [[superconductivity|superconductor]] acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior.

Diamagnetism was first discovered when Anton Brugmans observed in 1778 that bismuth was repelled by magnetic fields. In 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] demonstrated that it was a property of matter and concluded that every material responded (in either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic way) to an applied magnetic field. On a suggestion by William Whewell, Faraday first referred to the phenomenon as _diamagnetic_, then later changed it to _diamagnetism_.

If all electrons in the particle are paired, then the substance made of this particle is diamagnetic; If it has unpaired electrons, then the substance is paramagnetic.
