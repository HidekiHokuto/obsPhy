  abstract = {Experimental advances have allowed for the exploration of nearly isolated quantum many-body systems whose coupling to an external bath is very weak. A particularly interesting class of such systems is those that do not thermalize under their own isolated quantum dynamics. In this review, we highlight the possibility for such systems to exhibit new nonequilibrium phases of matter. In particular, we focus on discrete time crystals, which are many-body phases of matter characterized by a spontaneously broken discrete time-translation symmetry. We give a definition of discrete time crystals from several points of view, emphasizing that they are a nonequilibrium phenomenon that is stabilized by many-body interactions, with no analog in noninteracting systems. We explain the theory behind several proposed models of discrete time crystals, and compare several recent realizations, in different experimental contexts.},

  abstract = {The idea of breaking time-translation symmetry has fascinated humanity at least since ancient proposals of the perpetuum mobile. Unlike the breaking of other symmetries, such as spatial translation in a crystal or spin rotation in a magnet, time translation symmetry breaking (TTSB) has been tantalisingly elusive. We review this history up to recent developments which have shown that discrete TTSB does takes place in periodically driven (Floquet) systems in the presence of many-body localization. Such Floquet time-crystals represent a new paradigm in quantum statistical mechanics --- that of an intrinsically out-of-equilibrium many-body phase of matter. We include a compendium of necessary background, before specializing to a detailed discussion of the nature, and diagnostics, of TTSB. We formalize the notion of a time-crystal as a stable, macroscopic, conservative clock --- explaining both the need for a many-body system in the infinite volume limit, and for a lack of net energy absorption or dissipation. We also cover a range of related phenomena, including various types of long-lived prethermal time-crystals, and expose the roles played by symmetries -- exact and (emergent) approximate -- and their breaking. We clarify the distinctions between many-body time-crystals and other ostensibly similar phenomena dating as far back as the works of Faraday and Mathieu. En route, we encounter Wilczek's suggestion that macroscopic systems should exhibit TTSB in their ground states, together with a theorem ruling this out. We also analyze pioneering recent experiments detecting signatures of time crystallinity in a variety of different platforms, and provide a detailed theoretical explanation of the physics in each case. In all existing experiments, the system does not realize a `true' time-crystal phase, and we identify necessary ingredients for improvements in future experiments.},

  abstract = {The field of ultracold atomic physics has developed rapidly during the last two decades, and currently encompasses a broad range of topics in physics, with a variety of important applications in topics ranging from quantum computing and simulation to quantum metrology, and can be used to probe fundamental many-body effects such as superconductivity and superfluidity. Beginning with the underlying and including the most cutting-edge experimental developments, this textbook covers essential topics such as Bose-Einstein condensation of alkali atoms, studies of BEC-BCS crossover in degenerate Fermi gas, synthetic gauge fields and Hubbard models, and many-body localization and dynamical gauge fields. Key physical concepts, such as symmetry and universality highlight the connections between different systems, and theory is developed with plain derivations supported by experimental results. This self-contained and modern text will be invaluable for researchers, graduate students and advanced undergraduates studying cold atom physics, from both a theoretical and experimental perspective.},
