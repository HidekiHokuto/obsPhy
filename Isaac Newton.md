**Sir Isaac Newton** FRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author who was described in his time as a natural philosopher. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His pioneering book *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, first published in 1687, consolidated many of his previous results and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] for developing infinitesimal calculus.
