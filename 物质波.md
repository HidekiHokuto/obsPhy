# 德布罗意关系

The de Broglie relation, also known as the de Broglie's momentum–wavelength relation, generalizes the [[Planck relation]] to matter waves. [[Louis de Broglie]] argued that if particles had a wave nature, the relation $E=h\nu$ would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to $\lambda = h/p$. Combining *de Broglie's postulate* with the [[Planck relation|Planck–Einstein relation]] leads to

$$p = \hslash k,\quad \vb*{p} = \hslash \vb*{k}$$
