The Clausius theorem, also known as the _Clausius inequality_, states that for a thermodynamic system exchanging heat with [[external thermal reservoirs]] and undergoing a thermodynamic cycle, the following inequality holds.

$$
-\oint \dd{S}_{\text{Res}}
= \oint \frac{\delta{Q}}{T_{\text{surr}}} \leq 0
$$
