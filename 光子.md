A photon is an [[elementary particle]] that is a quantum of the [[electromagnetic field]], including electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio waves, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force. Photons are massless, so they always move at the *speed of light in vacuum*, $299792458\ \text{m/s}$. The photon belongs to the class of [[玻色子]] particles.
