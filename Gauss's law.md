In physics and electromagnetism, **Gauss's law**, also known as **Gauss's flux theorem**, (or sometimes simply called **Gauss's theorem**) is a law relating the distribution of electric charge to the resulting electric field.




# 1. Equation involving the $E$ field

## 1.1. Integral form

Gauss's law may be expressed as:

$$
\Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0}
$$
where $\Phi_E$ is the **electric flux** through a closed surface $S$ enclosing any volume $V$, $Q$ is the total charge enclosed within $V$, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the **electric constant**. The electric flux $\Phi_E$ is defined as a surface integral of the electric field:


$$
\Phi_E = \oiint_S \vb*{E} \vdot \dd{\vb*{A}}
$$
