In physics, an **anyon** is a type of [[准粒子]] that occurs only in *two-dimensional systems*, with properties much less restricted than the two kinds of standard elementary particles, [[费米子|fermions]] and [[玻色子|bosons]]. In general, the operation of exchanging two identical particles, although it may cause a *global phase shift*, cannot affect observables. Anyons are generally classified as *abelian* or *non-abelian*. *Abelian anyons* (detected by two experiments in 2020) play a major role in the [[分数量子霍尔效应]]. *Non-abelian anyons* have not been definitively detected, although this is an active area of research.
