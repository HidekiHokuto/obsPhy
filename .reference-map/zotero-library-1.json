  {"id":"aboumradQuantumComputingAnyons2022","abstract":"We introduce a pentagon equation solver, available as part of SageMath, and use it to construct braid group representations associated to certain anyon systems. We recall the category-theoretic framework for topological quantum computation to explain how these representations describe the sets of logical gates available to an anyonic quantum computer for information processing. In doing so, we avoid venturing deep into topological or conformal quantum field theory. Instead, we present anyons abstractly as sets of labels together with a collection of data satisfying a number of axioms, including the pentagon and hexagon equations, and explain how these data characterize ribbon fusion categories (RFCs). In the language of RFCs, our solver can produce $F$-matrices for anyon systems corresponding to multiplicity-free fusion rings arising in connection with the representation theory of quantum groups associated to simple Lie algebras with deformation parameter a root of unity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Aboumrad","given":"Willie"}],"citation-key":"aboumradQuantumComputingAnyons2022","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2212.00831","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","publisher":"[object Object]","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Quantum computing with anyons: an $F$-matrix and braid calculator","title-short":"Quantum computing with anyons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00831","version":"1"},

  {"id":"bhattacharjeeLanczosApproachAdiabatic2023","abstract":"The Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP) is the generator of adiabatic deformations between quantum eigenstates. There are many ways to construct the AGP operator and evaluate the AGP norm. Recently, it was proposed that a Gram-Schmidt-type algorithm can be used to explicitly evaluate the expression of the AGP. We employ a version of this approach by using the Lanczos algorithm to evaluate the AGP operator in terms of Krylov vectors and the AGP norm in terms of the Lanczos coefficients. It has the advantage of minimizing redundancies in evaluating the nested commutators in the analytic expression for the AGP operator. The algorithm is used to explicitly construct the AGP operator for some simple systems. We derive an integral transform relation between the AGP norm and the autocorrelation function of the deformation operator. We present a modification of the Variational approach to derive the regulated AGP norm. Using this, we approximate the AGP to varying degrees of success. Finally, we compare and contrast the quantum-chaos-probing capacities of the AGP and K-complexity in view of the Operator Growth Hypothesis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhattacharjee","given":"Budhaditya"}],"citation-key":"bhattacharjeeLanczosApproachAdiabatic2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2302.07228","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"A Lanczos approach to the Adiabatic Gauge Potential","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07228","version":"2"},

Here we propose to realize and detect Kitaev chiral spin liquid in a deformed honeycomb array of Rydberg atoms. Through a novel laser-assisted dipole-dipole interaction mechanism to generate both effective hopping and pairing terms for hard-core bosons, together with van der Waals interaction, we achieve the Kitaev spin liquid model with high precision. The gapped non-Abelian spin liquid phase is then obtained. Further, we propose to probe the chiral Majorana edge modes by light Bragg scattering and by imagining their chiral motion, in which only spin degree of freedom needs to be measured. Our work broadens the range of exotic quantum many-body phases that can be realized and detected in atomic systems, and makes an important step toward manipulating non-Abelian anyons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi-Hong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bao-Zong"},{"family":"Poon","given":"Ting-Fung Jeffrey"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xin-Chi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zheng-Xin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiong-Jun"}],"citation-key":"chenRealizationDetectionKitaev2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2310.12905","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Realization and detection of Kitaev quantum spin liquid with Rydberg atoms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12905","version":"1"},

We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities.

For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date—including fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons—this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged\n              2,3\n              . However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions\n              4–8\n              . Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well-developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals\n              9–22\n              , the experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. Whereas efforts on conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly manipulating the many-body wavefunction by means of unitary gates. Building on predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons\n              9,10\n              , we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol\n              23\n              to create and braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect of using the anyons for quantum computation and use braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides new insights about non-Abelian braiding and, through the future inclusion of error correction to achieve topological protection, could open a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"literal":"Google Quantum AI and Collaborators"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"T.

It provides a promising platform for realizing a Majorana zero mode trapped by a vison excitation. This local mode behaves as a non-Abelian anyon capable of applications to quantum computation. However, creating, observing, and manipulating visons remain challenging even in the pristine Kitaev model. Here, we propose a theory to control visons enabled by a time-dependent local magnetic field in the Kitaev spin liquid. Examining the time evolution of the magnetic state, we demonstrate that a vison follows a locally applied field sweeping in the system. We clarify that one can move a vison accompanied by a Majorana zero mode by choosing the velocity and shape of the local field appropriately. In particular, the controllability of visons using local fields shows nonlinear behavior for its strength, which originates from interactions between Majorana fermions and visons. The present results suggest that itinerant Majorana fermions other than zero modes play a crucial role in vison transport. Our finding will offer a guideline for controlling Majorana zero modes in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Harada","given":"Chihiro"},{"family":"Ono","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Nasu","given":"Joji"}],"citation-key":"haradaFielddrivenSpatiotemporalManipulation2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2305.08357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Field-driven spatiotemporal manipulation of Majorana zero modes in Kitaev spin liquid","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08357","version":"1"},

Their counterparts in condensed matter physics, Majorana zero-Modes (MZMs), have attracted remarkable attention in condensed matter for their potential in building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Due to the relentless effort, lots of important progress has been made in Majorana physics in the past two decades, as introduced in several excellent review articles. This review focuses on the non-Abelian statistics of MZMs and their application to quantum computation. In the first section of this work, the theoretical progress in searching for MZM is briefly reviewed and the latest experimental progresses are summarized. We next introduce the basic concepts of non-Abelian statistics of MZMs and explain how they can be applied to quantum computation. We then discuss two key experiments to implementing quantum computers in the MZM platform: MZM braiding and MZM qubit readout. In this part, several representative proposals for the Majorana braiding and MZM qubit readout are elaborated. Finally, we introduce a latest concept, the symmetry-protected non-Abelian braiding of Majorana Kramers pairs in time-reversal invariant topological superconductors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Ying-Ping"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Jian-Song"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiong-Jun"},{"literal":"International Center for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China"},{"literal":"Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter, Beijing 100871, China"},{"literal":"Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Science, Beijing 100193, China"},{"literal":"CAS Center for Excellence in Topological Quantum Computation, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China"}],"citation-key":"heNonabelianStatisticsMajorana2020","container-title":"Acta Physica Sinica","container-title-short":"Acta Phys.

The Kitaev honeycomb model and its generalizations to other tricoordinated lattices are chief counterexamples—they are exactly solvable, harbor a variety of quantum spin liquid phases, and are also relevant for certain transition metal compounds including the polymorphs of (Na,Li)\n              2\n              IrO\n              3\n              iridates and RuCl\n              3\n              .

  {"id":"khemaniBriefHistoryTime2019","abstract":"The idea of breaking time-translation symmetry has fascinated humanity at least since ancient proposals of the perpetuum mobile. Unlike the breaking of other symmetries, such as spatial translation in a crystal or spin rotation in a magnet, time translation symmetry breaking (TTSB) has been tantalisingly elusive. We review this history up to recent developments which have shown that discrete TTSB does takes place in periodically driven (Floquet) systems in the presence of many-body localization. Such Floquet time-crystals represent a new paradigm in quantum statistical mechanics --- that of an intrinsically out-of-equilibrium many-body phase of matter. We include a compendium of necessary background, before specializing to a detailed discussion of the nature, and diagnostics, of TTSB. We formalize the notion of a time-crystal as a stable, macroscopic, conservative clock --- explaining both the need for a many-body system in the infinite volume limit, and for a lack of net energy absorption or dissipation. We also cover a range of related phenomena, including various types of long-lived prethermal time-crystals, and expose the roles played by symmetries -- exact and (emergent) approximate -- and their breaking. We clarify the distinctions between many-body time-crystals and other ostensibly similar phenomena dating as far back as the works of Faraday and Mathieu. En route, we encounter Wilczek's suggestion that macroscopic systems should exhibit TTSB in their ground states, together with a theorem ruling this out. We also analyze pioneering recent experiments detecting signatures of time crystallinity in a variety of different platforms, and provide a detailed theoretical explanation of the physics in each case.

We introduce anyons at the system-independent level of anyon models and discuss the key concepts of protected fusion spaces and statistical quantum evolutions for encoding and processing quantum information. Both the encoding and the processing are inherently resilient against errors due to their topological nature, thus promising to overcome one of the main obstacles for the realisation of quantum computers. We outline the general steps of topological quantum computation, as well as discuss various challenges faced by it. We also review the literature on condensed matter systems where anyons can emerge. Finally, the appearance of anyons and employing them for quantum computation is demonstrated in the context of a simple microscopic model -- the topological superconducting nanowire -- that describes the low-energy physics of several experimentally relevant settings. This model supports localised Majorana zero modes that are the simplest and the experimentally most tractable types of anyons that are needed to perform topological quantum computation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lahtinen","given":"Ville"},{"family":"Pachos","given":"Jiannis K."}],"citation-key":"lahtinenShortIntroductionTopological2017","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.1705.04103","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"[object Object]","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"A Short Introduction to Topological Quantum Computation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04103","version":"4"},

These phases occur when the extended objects, called ``string-nets'', become highly fluctuating and condense. We derive exactly soluble Hamiltonians for 2D local bosonic models whose ground states are string-net condensed states. Those ground states correspond to 2D parity invariant topological phases. These models reveal the mathematical framework underlying topological phases: tensor category theory. One of the Hamiltonians - a spin-1/2 system on the honeycomb lattice - is a simple theoretical realization of a fault tolerant quantum computer.

First we present the exact solution of Kitaev model using Majorana fermionisation and elaborate in detail the $Z_2$ gauge structure. Following this we discuss exact calculation of magnetization, spin-spin correlation function establishing its spin-liquid character. Spin fractionalization and de-confinement of Majorana fermion is explained in detail. Existence of long range multi-spin correlation function and topological degeneracy are discussed to elucidate the entangled and topological nature of any eigenstate.

  {"id":"oregMajoranaZeroModes2020","abstract":"Recent experimental progress introduced devices that can combine topological superconductivity with Coulomb-blockade effects. Experiments with these devices have already provided additional evidence for Majorana zero modes in proximity-coupled semiconductor wires. They also stimulated numerous ideas for how to exploit interactions between Majorana zero modes generated by Coulomb charging effects in networks of Majorana wires. Coulomb effects promise to become a powerful tool in the quest for a topological quantum computer as well as for driving topological superconductors into topologically ordered insulating states. Here, we present a focused review of these recent developments, including discussions of recent experiments, designs of topological qubits, Majorana-based implementations of universal quantum computation, and topological quantum error correction. Motivated by the analogy between a qubit and a spin-1/2 degree of freedom, we also review how coupling between Cooper-pair boxes leads to emergent topologically ordered insulating phases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Oreg","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Von Oppen","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"oregMajoranaZeroModes2020","container-title":"Annual Review of Condensed Matter Physics","container-title-short":"Annu.

While their development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term, equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single and many-particle models. The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by an algorithmic method.

  {"id":"wenTopologicalOrderLongrange2013","abstract":"In primary school, we were told that there are four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than four states of matter. For example, there are ferromagnetic states as revealed by the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the phenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so rich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress in last 20 -- 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more interesting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new \"topological\" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new \"topological\" phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order, topological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion category and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum entanglements, just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair condensation. Long-range quantum entanglements lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian statistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum entanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more generally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics): light waves (gauge fields) are fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are defects of long-range entanglements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wen","given":"Xiao-Gang"}],"citation-key":"wenTopologicalOrderLongrange2013","container-title":"ISRN Condensed Matter Physics","container-title-short":"ISRN Condensed Matter Physics","DOI":"10.1155/2013/198710","ISSN":"2090-7400","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,27]]},"page":"1-20","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Topological order: from long-range entangled quantum matter to an unification of light and electrons","title-short":"Topological order","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1281","volume":"2013"},

We concentrate on characterization of the different topological orders. As an example we discuss in detail chiral spin states of 2 + 1 dimensional spin systems. Chiral spin states are described by the topological Chern-Simons theories in the continuum limit. We show that the topological orders can be characterized by a non-Abelian gauge structure over the moduli space which parametrizes a family of the model Hamiltonians supporting topologically ordered ground states. In 2 + 1 dimensions, the non-Abelian gauge structure determines possible fractional statistics of the quasi-particle excitations over the topologically ordered ground states. The dynamics of the low lying global excitations is shown to be independent of random spatial dependent perturbations. The ground state degeneracy and the non-Abelian gauge structures discussed in this paper are very robust, even against those perturbations that break translation symmetry. We also discuss the symmetry properties of the degenerate ground states of chiral spin states. We find that some degenerate ground states of chiral spin states on torus carry non-trivial quantum numbers of the 90° rotation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wen","given":"X.

  {"id":"xuDigitalSimulationProjective2023","abstract":"Non-Abelian anyons are exotic quasiparticle excitations hosted by certain topological phases of matter. They break the fermion-boson dichotomy and obey non-Abelian braiding statistics: their interchanges yield unitary operations, rather than merely a phase factor, in a space spanned by topologically degenerate wavefunctions. They are the building blocks of topological quantum computing. However, experimental observation of non-Abelian anyons and their characterizing braiding statistics is notoriously challenging and has remained elusive hitherto, in spite of various theoretical proposals. Here, we report an experimental quantum digital simulation of projective non-Abelian anyons and their braiding statistics with up to 68 programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a two-dimensional lattice. By implementing the ground states of the toric-code model with twists through quantum circuits, we demonstrate that twists exchange electric and magnetic charges and behave as a particular type of non-Abelian anyons, i.e., the Ising anyons. In particular, we show experimentally that these twists follow the fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding statistics of the Ising type, and can be explored to encode topological logical qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to implement both single- and two-qubit logic gates through applying a sequence of elementary Pauli gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results demonstrate a versatile quantum digital approach for simulating non-Abelian anyons, offering a new lens into the study of such peculiar quasiparticles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Shibo"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Zheng-Zhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Bao","given":"Zehang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zitian"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Fanhao"},{"family":"Song","given":"Zixuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Pengfei"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Wenhui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Hang"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Jinfeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jiachen"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yaozu"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Ziqi"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Feitong"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xuhao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chuanyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Yiren"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Jiarun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Aosai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weikang"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Wenjie"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Li-Wei"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yunyan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hekang"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Qiujiang"},{"family":"Song","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"H."},{"family":"Deng","given":"Dong-Ling"}],"citation-key":"xuDigitalSimulationProjective2023","container-title":"Chinese Physics Letters","container-title-short":"Chinese Phys.

Similarly, spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder systems with bond-dependent Ising interactions, featuring Majorana fermions coupled with $Z_2$ flux, exhibit boundary Majorana modes when in a topological phase. However, the ground state degeneracy, inherent in these systems, may result in the annihilation of Majorana modes due to the superposition of the two states. To address this issue, we introduce a projective measurement that selects one of the degenerate $Z_2$ sectors, enabling the emergence of Majorana modes. Once the state is selected, we show that the application of the local spin operators on a bond flips the sign of the adjacent $Z_2$ flux. Repeating such operators enables the system to reach a desired $Z_2$ flux configuration. We present the phase diagram and the appearance of Majorana modes at the interfaces of topological and non-topological phases. These modes, along with boundary Majorana modes, can be manipulated and fused by tuning the flux sectors achievable through applying local spin operators. We also discuss the engineering of the Kitaev ladder and open questions for future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Haoting"},{"family":"Kee","given":"Hae-Young"}],"citation-key":"xuManipulatingMajoranaZero2024","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2404.16099","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives 4.0 International","publisher":"[object Object]","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Manipulating Majorana zero modes in the spin-1/2 Kitaev ladder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16099","version":"1"},

Topological quantum computation attracts great attention because it emerges as one of the most promising approaches to solving these problems. Various theoretical schemes for building topological quantum computation have been proposed. However, experimental implementation has always been a great challenge because it has proved to be extremely difficult to create and manipulate topological qubits in real systems. Therefore, topological quantum computation has not been realized in experiments yet. Herein, the first experimental simulation of topological quantum computation with classical circuits is reported. Based on the proposed new scheme with circuits, not only Majorana‐like edge states are simulated experimentally, but also T junctions are constructed for simulating the braiding process. Furthermore, the feasibility of simulated topological quantum computing through a set of one‐ and two‐qubit unitary operations is demonstrated. Finally, the simulation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that simulated topological quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks. The developed circuit‐based topological quantum‐computing simulator can provide important references for developing future topological quantum circuits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"Deyuan"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Naiqiao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Houjun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiangdong"}],"citation-key":"zouExperimentalSimulationTopological2023","container-title":"Advanced Intelligent Systems","container-title-short":"Advanced Intelligent Systems","DOI":"10.1002/aisy.202300354","ISSN":"2640-4567, 2640-4567","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"en","page":"2300354","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Experimental Simulation of Topological Quantum Computing with Classical Circuits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aisy.202300354","volume":"5"}
