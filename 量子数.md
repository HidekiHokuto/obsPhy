# Overview

# 好量子数

A good quantum number is a quantum number that remains **constant** throughout a particular physical process or chemical reaction. This means that it is a property of a system that is **conserved** during the process or reaction. 

Examples of good quantum numbers include,
- the total energy of a system
- the [[全角动量]]
- the total [[自旋]]

These quantum numbers are important in determining the allowed energy states and transitions of atoms and molecules, and they play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular level.

# 坏量子数

A bad quantum number is a quantum number that is not conserved during a particular physical process or chemical reaction. An example of a bad quantum number is the azimuthal quantum number (l) in the presence of a magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, the azimuthal quantum number determines the magnitude of the angular momentum of an electron in an atom. However, in the presence of a magnetic field, the angular momentum of the electron is no longer conserved, and the azimuthal quantum number is no longer a good quantum number. Instead, the magnetic quantum number (m) becomes a good quantum number, as it determines the orientation of the angular momentum vector with respect to the magnetic field.
