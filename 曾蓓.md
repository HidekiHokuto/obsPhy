**Bei Zeng**![[1569509246_p.jpg#R|曾蓓|200]] received the B.Sc. degree in physics and mathematics and M.Sc. degree in physics from [[清华大学|Tsinghua University]], in 2002 and 2004, respectively.  She received the Ph.D. degree in physics from [[麻省理工学院|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in 2009. From 2009 to 2010, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and the Department of Combinatorics & Optimization, University of Waterloo. In 2010, she joined the Department of Mathematics & Statistics, University of Guelph, as an assistant professor, and promoted to Tenured Associate Professor in 2014 and Professor in 2018. In 2019, she joined the Department of Physics, [[香港科技大学|The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], as a Professor.

Prof. Zeng’s research strives to bring us closer to the goal of reliable transmission and processing of quantum information. From the theoretical point of view, she is seeking to construct a broad theory for building a large class of quantum error-correcting codes. From the practical point of view, her focus is on the design of quantum error-correcting codes with nice properties that are suitable for high rate quantum information transmission through practical physical channels, and reliable quantum computation with high noise tolerance and low resource requirement.
