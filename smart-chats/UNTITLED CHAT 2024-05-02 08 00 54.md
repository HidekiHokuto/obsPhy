Based on your notes, Xiao-Gang Wen is a Chinese-American physicist known for his expertise in condensed matter theory in strongly correlated electronic systems. He holds the position of Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is a Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Wen was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in October 2016. He authored a book on advanced quantum many-body theory titled "Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons." Wen obtained his B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China and completed his M.A. and Ph.D. in Physics at Princeton University. Initially studying superstring theory under Edward Witten, he later transitioned to condensed matter physics and conducted research at UC Santa Barbara.
