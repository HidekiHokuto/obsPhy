- Majorana equation

In physics, the Majorana equation is a relativistic wave equation. It is named after the Italian physicist [[Ettore Majorana]], who proposed it in 1937 as a means of describing [[费米子|fermions]] that are their own [[antiparticle]]. Particles corresponding to this equation are termed [[Majorana particle|Majorana particles]], although that term now has a more expansive meaning, referring to any (possibly non-relativistic) fermionic particle that is its own antiparticle (and is therefore electrically neutral).
