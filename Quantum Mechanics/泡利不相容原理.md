Pauli exclusion principle indicates that two identical fermions cannot be in the same quantum state.

For instance, electrons are [[费米子]], within an atom, every electron owns a ***unique*** set of [[量子数]] $n,l,m,s$. 

Any two electrons, if their quantum numbers $n, l, m$ are the same, they must have opposite spins. In other words, two electrons occupy the same atomic orbit must have opposite spin directions.
