- Ehrenfest theorem
---

The **Ehrenfest theorem**, named after [[Paul Ehrenfest]], relates the time derivative of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators $x$ and $p$ to the *expectation value of the force* 
$$
m\dv{t}\ev{x} = \ev{p}, \quad \dv{t}\ev{p}=-\ev{V'(x)}
$$
The Ehrenfest theorem is a special case of a more general relation between the expectation of any quantum mechanical operator and the expectation of the [[对易子]] of that operator with the Hamiltonian of the system

$$
\dv{t}\ev{A} = \frac{1}{\mi \hslash} \ev{\comm{A}{H}}
+ \ev{\pdv{A}{t}}
$$

where $A$ is some quantum mechanical operator and $\ev{A}$ is its expectation value.
