In quantum mechanics, the **Hamiltonian** of a system is an operator corresponding to the *total energy* of that system, including both kinetic energy and potential energy.

The Hamiltonian is named after [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who developed a revolutionary reformulation of *Newtonian mechanics*, known as [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], which was historically important to the development of quantum physics. Similar to vector notation, it is typically denoted by $\hat{H}$, where the hat indicates that it is an operator.
