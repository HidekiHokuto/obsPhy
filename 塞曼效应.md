The **Zeeman effect** is the effect of splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is named after the Dutch physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]], who discovered it in 1896 and received a Nobel prize for this discovery. It is analogous to the [[斯塔克效应]], the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field. Also similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the [[dipole]] approximation), as governed by the [[selection rule|selection rules]].
