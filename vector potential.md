In vector calculus, a **vector potential** is a vector field whose [[curl]] is a given vector field. This is analogous to a [[scalar potential]], which is a scalar field whose [[gradient]] is a given vector field.

Formally, given a vector field $\vb*{v}$, a vector potential is a $C^{2}$ vector field $\vb*{A}$ such that

$$\vb*{v} = \curl \vb*{A}$$
