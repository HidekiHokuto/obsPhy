**Lev Davidovich Landau**![[440px-Landau.jpg#RIGHT|Lev Landau|200]] (22 January 1908 – 1 April 1968) was a Soviet-Azerbaijani physicist who made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics.

His accomplishments include the independent co-discovery of the [[密度矩阵|density matrix]] method in quantum mechanics (alongside [[John von Neumann]]), the quantum mechanical theory of [[抗磁性]], the theory of [[超导体]], the theory of [[second-order phase transitions]], the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]] of [[superconductivity]], the theory of [[Fermi liquids]], the explanation of Landau damping in plasma physics, the [[Landau pole]] in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of [[中微子]], and Landau's equations for $S$ matrix singularities. He received the 1962 [[诺贝尔奖]] for his development of a mathematical theory of superfluidity that accounts for the properties of liquid helium II at a temperature below $2.17\ \text{K}$ ($−270.98\ \degree \text{C}$).
