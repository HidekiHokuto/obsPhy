**Xiao-Gang Wen**![[XGWen.jpg#R|Xiao-Gang Wen|200]] (文小刚; born November 26, 1961) is a Chinese-American physicist. He is a Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at the [[麻省理工学院]] and Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. His expertise is in *condensed matter theory* in *strongly correlated electronic systems*. In Oct. 2016, he was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize.

He is the author of a book in advanced quantum many-body theory entitled *Quantum Field Theory of Many-body Systems: From the Origin of Sound to an Origin of Light and Electrons* (Oxford University Press, 2004).

# Early life and education

Wen attended the [[中国科学技术大学|University of Science and Technology of China]] and earned a B.S. in Physics in 1982.

In 1982, Wen came to the US for graduate school via the CUSPEA program, which was organized by Prof. [[李政道|T. D. Lee]]. He attended [[普林斯顿大学|Princeton University]], from which be attained an M.A. in Physics in 1983 and a Ph.D in Physics in 1987.
# Work

Wen studied superstring theory under theoretical physicist [[Edward Witten]] at Princeton University where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1987. He later switched his research field to condensed matter physics while working with theoretical physicists [[John Robert Schrieffer|Robert Schrieffer]], [[Frank Wilczek]], [[徐一鸿]] in Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara (1987–1989).
