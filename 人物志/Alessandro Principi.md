Dr **Alessandro Principi**![[face.jpg.webp#R|Alessandro Principi|200]] is a Senior Lecturer in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics at the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the [[曼彻斯特大学|University of Manchester]].

His research focuses on the study of systems where strong interactions lead to the formation of exotic quantum phases. Examples are superconductors, magnetic systems, twisted bilayer graphene, quantum spin liquids and topologically-ordered systems. In these systems, novel (quasi)particles can emerge. Some of these, names "anyons, have no counterpart in high-energy physics and can find application to (topological) quantum computation.  
  
Principi's studies theoretical models that can be treated with (quasi)analytical techniques. With a wealth of quantum-field theoretical theoretical methods he addressed equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of such systems. Amongst the others, the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour of quantum particles.
