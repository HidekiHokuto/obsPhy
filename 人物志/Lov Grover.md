**Lov Kumar Grover** (born 1961) is an Indian-American computer scientist. He is the originator of the Grover database search algorithm used in quantum computing. Grover's 1996 algorithm won renown as the second major algorithm proposed for quantum computing (after [[Peter Shor|Shor]]'s 1994 algorithm), and in 2017 was finally implemented in a scalable physical quantum system. Grover's algorithm has been the subject of numerous popular science articles.

Grover received his bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1981 and his PhD in Electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1985. In 1984, he went to Bell Laboratories. He worked as a visiting professor at [[康奈尔大学|Cornell University]] from 1987 to 1994. He retired in 2008 becoming an independent researcher.
