**Alexei Yurievich Kitaev**![[licensed-image.jpeg#RIGHT|Алексей Юрьевич Китаев|200]] (Russian: Алексей Юрьевич Китаев; born August 26, 1963) is a Russian–American professor of physics at the [[加州理工学院]] and permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. He is best known for introducing the quantum phase estimation algorithm and the concept of the topological quantum computer while working at the [[朗道理论物理研究所]]. For this work, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008. He is also known for introducing the complexity class QMA and showing the 2-local Hamiltonian problem is QMA-complete, the most complete result for k-local Hamiltonians. Kitaev is also known for contributions to research on a model relevant to researchers of the AdS/CFT correspondence started by [[Subir Sachdev]] and [[叶锦武|Jinwu Ye]]; this model is known as the [[Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model]].

Kitaev was educated in Russia, receiving an M.Sc. from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (1986), and a Ph.D. from the [[朗道理论物理研究所|Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (1989). He served previously as a researcher (1999–2001) at Microsoft Research, a research associate (1989–1998) at the Landau Institute and a professor at [[加州理工学院|Caltech]] (2002–present).

# Honors and awards

In 2008 Kitaev was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

In July 2012, he was an inaugural awardee of the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the creation of physicist and internet entrepreneur, Yuri Milner.

In 2015, he was jointly awarded the 2015 [[狄拉克奖|Dirac Medal]] by ICTP.

In 2017, he was, together with [[文小刚]], the winner of the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize.

In 2021, he was elected into the National Academy of Sciences.
