**Albert Einstein**![[Einstein_1921.jpg#RIGHT|Einstein|200]] (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Best known for developing the *theory of relativity*, he also made important contributions to the development of the *theory of quantum mechanics*. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His *mass–energy equivalence* formula $E = mc^2$, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 [[诺贝尔奖]] "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[光电效应]]", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius". Einsteinium, one of the synthetic elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.
