**William Bradford Shockley Jr.**![[William_Shockley,_Stanford_University.jpg#R|William Shockley|200]] (February 13, 1910 – August 12, 1989) was an American inventor, physicist, and eugenicist. He was the manager of a research group at Bell Labs that included [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain|Walter Brattain]]. The three scientists were jointly awarded the 1956 [[诺贝尔奖|Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect".

Partly as a result of Shockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s, California's Silicon Valley became a hotbed of electronics innovation.

In his later life, while a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University and afterward, Shockley became widely known for his racist views and advocacy of eugenics.
