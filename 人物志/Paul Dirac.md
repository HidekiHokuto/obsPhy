# 1. Overview


**Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac**![[Paul_Dirac,_1933.jpg#R|Paul Dirac|200]] OM FRS (8 August 1902 – 20 October 1984) was an English theoretical physicist who is regarded as one of the most significant physicists of the 20th century. He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a professor of physics at Florida State University and the University of Miami, and a 1933 [[诺贝尔奖|Nobel Prize in Physics]] recipient.

Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other discoveries, he formulated the [[狄拉克方程]] which describes the behavior of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 [[诺贝尔奖|Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Erwin Schrödinger]] "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory". He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics.
