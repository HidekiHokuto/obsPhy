**杨振宁**![[Yang.jpg#RIGHT|杨振宁|200]] (born 1 October 1922), also known as C. N. Yang or by the English name Frank Yang, is a Chinese theoretical physicist who made significant contributions to statistical mechanics, integrable systems, gauge theory, and both particle physics and condensed matter physics. He and [[李政道|Tsung-Dao Lee]] received the 1957 [[诺贝尔奖]] for their work on parity non-conservation of weak interaction. The two proposed that one of the basic quantum-mechanics laws, the conservation of parity, is violated in the so-called weak nuclear reactions, those nuclear processes that result in the emission of beta or alpha particles. Yang is also well known for his collaboration with Robert Mills in developing non-abelian gauge theory, widely known as the [[Yang–Mills theory]].

Yang entered the [[芝加哥大学|University of Chicago]] in January 1946 and studied with Edward Teller. He received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1948.[2]
