**Ettore Majorana**![[Ettore_Majorana.jpg#R|Ettore Majorana|200]] (born on 5 August 1906 – possibly dying after 1959) was an Italian theoretical physicist who worked on neutrino masses. On 25 March 1938, he disappeared under mysterious circumstances after purchasing a ticket to travel by ship from Palermo to Naples.

The [[马约拉纳方程]] and [[Majorana 费米子|Majorana fermions]] are named after him. In 2006, the Majorana Prize was established in his memory.
