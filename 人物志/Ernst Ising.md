**Ernst Ising**![[csm_Ernest_Ising_1987_096487330e.jpg#R|Ernst Ising|200]] (May 10, 1900 in Cologne, Germany – May 11, 1998 in Peoria, Illinois, USA) was a German physicist, who is best remembered for the development of the [[伊辛模型]]. He was a professor of physics at Bradley University until his retirement in 1976.

# 1. Work

The [[伊辛模型]] is defined on a discrete collection of variables called spins, which can take on the value $1$ or $-1$. The spins $S_{i}$ interact in pairs, with energy that has one value when the two spins are the same, and a second value when the two spins are different.

The energy of the [[伊辛模型]] is defined to be:

$$
\Energy = - \sum_{\ev{ij}} J_{ij} S_i S_j
$$

where the sum counts each pair of spins only once. Notice that the product of spins is either $+1$ if the two spins are the same (_aligned_), or $-1$ if they are different (_anti-aligned_). $J$ is half the difference in energy between the two possibilities. Magnetic interactions seek to align spins relative to one another. Spins become randomized when thermal energy is greater than the strength of the interaction.

For each pair, if
- $J_{ij} > 0$, the interaction is called [[铁磁性|ferromagnetic]]
- $J_{ij} < 0$, the interaction is called [[抗磁性|diamagnetic]]
- $J_{ij} = 0$, the spins are _noninteracting_

A *ferromagnetic* interaction tends to *align* spins, and an *antiferromagnetic* tends to *antialign* them.
