**Charles L. Kane**![[500px-Charles_L._Kane.jpg#R|Charles L. Kane|300]] (born January 12, 1963) is a theoretical condensed matter physicist and is the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Physics at the [[宾夕法尼亚大学|University of Pennsylvania]]. He completed a B.S. in physics at the [[芝加哥大学|University of Chicago]] in 1985 and his Ph.D. at [[麻省理工学院|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1989. Prior to joining the faculty at the [[宾夕法尼亚大学|University of Pennsylvania]] he was a postdoctoral associate at IBM's T. J. Watson Research Center working with his mentor Matthew P. A. Fisher, among others.

Kane is notable for theoretically predicting the [[量子自旋霍尔效应|quantum spin Hall effect]] (originally in graphene) and what would later be known as [[拓扑绝缘体|topological insulators]].

He received the 2012 [[狄拉克奖|Dirac Prize]], along with [[张首晟|Shoucheng Zhang]] and [[Duncan Haldane|Duncan Haldane]], for their groundbreaking work on two- and three-dimensional [[拓扑绝缘体|topological insulators]]. In the same year he was also chosen for the inaugural class of Mathematics and the Physical Sciences Simons Investigators. He also shared one of the 2013 Physics Frontiers prizes with Laurens Molenkamp and Shoucheng Zhang for their work on [[拓扑绝缘体|topological insulators]]. In 2018 he shared the Frontiers of Knowledge Award with Eugene Mele. In 2019 was recognized with Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with fellow [[宾夕法尼亚大学|University of Pennsylvania]] professor Eugene Mele, again for work on [[拓扑绝缘体|topological insulators]].
