**Hendrik Antoon Lorentz**![[H_A_Lorentz_(Nobel).jpg#RIGHT|Hendrik Lorentz|200]] (18 July 1853 – 4 February 1928) was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 [[诺贝尔奖]] with [[Pieter Zeeman]] for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the [[塞曼效应]]. He derived the Lorentz transformation which [[Albert Einstein]] subsequently used to make claims to special theory of relativity, as well as the Lorentz force, which describes the combined electric and magnetic forces acting on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. Lorentz was also responsible for the Lorentz oscillator model, a classical model used to describe the anomalous dispersion observed in dielectric materials when the driving frequency of the electric field was near the resonant frequency, resulting in abnormal refractive indices.

According to the biography published by the Nobel Foundation, "It may well be said that Lorentz was regarded by all theoretical physicists as the world's leading spirit, who completed what was left unfinished by his predecessors and prepared the ground for the fruitful reception of the new ideas based on the quantum theory." He received many other honours and distinctions, including a term as chairman of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, the forerunner of UNESCO, between 1925 and 1928.
