**Max Theodor Felix von Laue**![[460px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-U0205-502,_Max_von_Laue.jpg#RIGHT|Max von Laue|200]] (9 October 1879 – 24 April 1960) was a German physicist who received the [[诺贝尔奖]] in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals.

In addition to his scientific endeavors with contributions in optics, crystallography, quantum theory, [[superconductivity]], and the theory of relativity, Laue had a number of administrative positions which advanced and guided German scientific research and development during four decades. A strong objector to Nazism, he was instrumental in re-establishing and organizing German science after World War II.
