He shared the 1999 [[诺贝尔奖|Nobel Prize in Physics]] with his thesis advisor [[Martinus J. G. Veltman|Martinus J. G. Veltman]] "for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions".

His work concentrates on gauge theory, black holes, quantum gravity and fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. His contributions to physics include a proof that gauge theories are renormalizable, dimensional regularization and the holographic principle.
