**Louis Victor Pierre Raymond**![[Broglie_Big.jpg#RIGHT|Louis de Broglie|200]], 7th Duc de Broglie (15 August 1892 – 19 March 1987) was a French physicist and aristocrat who made groundbreaking contributions to quantum theory. In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the *de Broglie hypothesis*, an example of [[wave-particle duality]], and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.

De Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.
