**Oliver Heaviside**![[Oheaviside.jpg#RIGHT|Oliver Heaviside|200]] FRS (18 May 1850 – 3 February 1925) was an English self-taught mathematician and physicist who invented a new technique for solving differential equations (equivalent to the [[Laplace transform]]), independently developed vector calculus, and rewrote [[麦克斯韦方程组]] in the form commonly used today. He significantly shaped the way [[麦克斯韦方程组]] are understood and applied in the decades following Maxwell's death. His formulation of the telegrapher's equations became commercially important during his own lifetime, after their significance went unremarked for a long while, as few others were versed at the time in his novel methodology. Although at odds with the scientific establishment for most of his life, Heaviside changed the face of telecommunications, mathematics, and science.
