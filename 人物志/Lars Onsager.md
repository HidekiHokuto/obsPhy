**Lars Onsager** (November 27, 1903 – October 5, 1976) was an American physical chemist and theoretical physicist. He held the Gibbs Professorship of Theoretical Chemistry at Yale University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968.

# Education and early life

Lars Onsager was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His father was a lawyer. After completing secondary school in Oslo, he attended the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim, graduating as a chemical engineer in 1925.

# Career and research
In 1925 he arrived at a correction to the [[Debye-Hückel theory]] of electrolytic solutions, to specify [[Brownian movement]] of ions in solution, and during 1926 published it. He traveled to Zürich, where [[Peter Debye]] was teaching, and confronted Debye, telling him his theory was wrong. He impressed Debye so much that he was invited to become Debye's assistant at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH), where he remained until 1928.
