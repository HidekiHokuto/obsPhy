**Richard Phillips Feynman**![[Richard_Feynman_Nobel.jpg#RIGHT|Richard Feynman|200]] (May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the [[路径积分]] of quantum mechanics, the theory of [[quantum electrodynamics]], the physics of the [[超导体]] of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the [[parton model]]. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the [[诺贝尔奖]] in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and [[朝永 振一郎|Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]].

Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as [[费曼图|Feynman diagrams]]. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal *Physics World*, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.

He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle *Challenger* disaster. Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.

Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called *There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom* and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*. Feynman also became known through his autobiographical books *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!* and *What Do You Care What Other People Think?*, and books written about him such as *Tuva or Bust!* by Ralph Leighton and the biography Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.
