# 1. Overview

In thermodynamics, a [[相|phase]] transition is a physical process a state of matter and another. One phase of a thermodynamic system and states of matter have uniform physical properties.

During a phase transition of a given medium, certain properties of the medium change due to the change of external conditions, such as temperature or pressure.

# 2. Mechanism

## The singularity of Thermodynamic Functions

In thermodynamics, a (安定 stable?) system requires concave descending  free energy in terms of temperature. In other word, the continuity of the free energy function are guaranteed. Nonetheless, the in discontinuities or divergences might happen to its derivatives.
即使自由能对于温度连续, its first order derivative, entropy (temperature), magnetization (magnetic field) might discontinue; the [[heat capacity]]，[[magnetic susceptibility]] with respect to its second order derivatives may divergence.
