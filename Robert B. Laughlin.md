**Robert Betts Laughlin**![[Robert_Laughlin,_Stanford_University.jpg#RIGHT|Robert Betts Laughlin|200]] (born November 1, 1950) is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University. Along with Horst L. Störmer of Columbia University and [[崔琦|Daniel C. Tsui]] of Princeton University, he was awarded a share of the 1998 [[诺贝尔奖]] for their explanation of the [[分数量子霍尔效应]].

In 1983, Laughlin was first to provide a many body wave function, now known as the [[Laughlin wavefunction]], for the [[分数量子霍尔效应]], which was able to correctly explain the fractionalized charge observed in experiments. This state has since been interpreted as the integer quantum Hall effect of the composite [[费米子]].

His 2017 paper, "Pumped thermal grid storage with heat exchange" inspired Project Malta at Google X and subsequently Malta inc.
