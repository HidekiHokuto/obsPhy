A **black body** is an idealized physical body that absorbs *all* incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. The radiation emitted by a black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] with its environment is called [[black-body radiation]]. The name "black body" is given because it absorbs all colors of light. In contrast, a white body is one with a "rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions."

A black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic black-body radiation. The radiation is emitted according to Planck's law, meaning that it has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.

An ideal black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] has two main properties:

1. It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.
2. It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated isotropically, independent of direction.

# Radiative cooling

The integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature $T$, and is known as the [[斯特藩-玻尔兹曼定律]]:

$$P/A = \sigma T^4$$
